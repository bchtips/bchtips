# BCH Tips
BCH Tips is a browser extension for easy, trustless tipping with Bitcoin Cash on social media.

Features include:
* All tips on-chain and sent from your browser - no third party ever holds your funds.
* Browser-based wallet - no need to load a separate program. Key stored locally in browser. Address generation, if used, performed locally in browser. Transactions are transmitted to nodes directly from the extension.
* Tip buttons added to social media sites for easy access - just click **send tip** beneath the post or comment you want to tip the author of. BCH/USD estimates are updated live as you contemplate the amount and any reply.
* Automatic detection of tip addresses posted in public user profiles or submitted to our database.

# Reddit Usage
Each post and comment features a new **send tip** link in the toolbar. When clicked, the poster's user profile page will be searched for a Bitcoin Cash address, with or without the bitcoincash: prefix. If an address is not found a request will be made to our database to see if the user submitted an address. Tip and optional reply and PM options will appear on the page. After choosing the tip amount and submitting, if an address was found the transaction will be transmitted. If an address was not found the tip will be pending until the user adds an address to their profile or submits an address via PM to /u/bchtips (the address may be put anywhere in the subject or message body). Once the user has an address the extension will automatically send the tip you authorized next time you're online. You can view a history of tips you've sent and monitor the progress of acceptance and confirmation in the extension popup from the toolbar.
